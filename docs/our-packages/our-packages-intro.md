# Packages
Meta-System's architecture allows for pretty much anything we would like to plug in to be easy with a simple configuration on hand, and such modularity increases a developer's motivation to keep everything on its own place.

We dedicated this section to curate the modules we and the community like the best, along with some information on them.

Also, since we already have some modules the team members developed, here we take some space to document them. Some are protocols, some other are functions Packages, and we even have a [nice boilerplate for you to develop your own Function](../guides/writing-packages-and-functions)!

By the way, all of them are also open source, so you can review the code, modify it to your liking, and even republish!

## Protocols
So far the team behind Meta-System, have 2 published protocols:
- [http-json-meta-protocol](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-json-meta-protocol) - Parse and use JSON in HTTP routes - [View Documentation](./http-json)
- [cronjob-protocol](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cronjob-protocol) - Execute BOps in a timely fashion - [View Documentation](./cronjob)

## Packages & Functions
Here are the packages and standalone functions we developed ourselves:
- [logger-meta-functions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/logger-meta-functions) - A log suite to use in your BOps
- [bops-function-hello-world](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bops-function-hello-world) - A hello `<name>` module to use as boilerplate
