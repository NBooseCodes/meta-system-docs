# Meta-System
Meta-System is an extensible and modular no-code engine, built for everyone, free and open-source.

It aims to simplify software as a whole, freeing you, the developer, to work on what makes your software truly unique. It does so by being simple, capable, and [extensible](./architecture/extending-functionality): Just give Meta-System (**MSYS** for short) a configuration file and watch as it builds http routes, databases, functions and *voilÃ !* Your system should be up and running!

-----
## Features
- **Build Anything!** : Meta-System wasn't made for "a type" of software, meaning you can build anything you like!
- **Simple, Yet Extensible** : Its modular design allows you for adding, creating **and sharing** Add-ons, expanding your possibilities as far as you need them.
- **Unopinionated** : Meta-System doesn't make decisions for you, instead, it opens the path for you to focus only in what is necessary. Of course, however, you can extend it with your own opinions as you wish.
- **The Power of JSON** : Your Meta-System is configured using human-readable, and machine-parseable JSON.

## How To Use
Oversimplifying, It is actually as easy as:
1. Download Meta-System.
2. Configure your system's behavior.
3. Launch!
 
### 1. Downloading Meta-System
The Meta-System can be downloaded through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meta-system). If you have NodeJs installed you probably already have npm and it is a matter of installing with the command
`npm install -g meta-system`
> Note: If you don't have NodeJs and/or npm installed, more info on those can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### 2. Configuring your first system
For you to make Meta-System into your very own system, you'll need a configuration file. [Here](./configuring/basics.md) you can check in depth how to configure Meta-System. If you're new around, though, here's a classic:  **FizzBuzz**!

Let's get going:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import ExampleConfig from '!!raw-loader!/static/jsons/example.txt';

<details>
  <summary><b>Click to Show Example Config <nbsp/>
</b></summary>
<CodeBlock className="language-json">{ExampleConfig}</CodeBlock>
</details><br/>

Simply copy and paste the configuration above into a new text file and save it as `example.json` (you may change the name later, just make sure it is a `.json`).
Now, that you have installed Meta-System and have a configuration ready to go, all there is to do is run Meta-System!

### 3. Launching Meta-System
You can launch instances of Meta-System my the CLI command `meta-system run`. To continue our example, try doing:

- `meta-system run path/to/file/example.json` on Unix Systems;
- `meta-system run path\to\file\example.json` on Windows;

You should be now seeing your configuration being validated, then brought to life by Meta-System, ready-to-go.

## Use-Cases
What people can build with MSYS? What is possible?

As an engine, Meta-System can be used to power any kind of software, as long as the target platform allows for running NodeJS or browser-based JavaScript.
Also, because it is extensible, you're never limited to only what you have in the engine. The combination of these properties sets Meta-System as a versatile lightweight no-code tool for almost any task.
- **A Backup Daemon** : Configured to automatically run at startup, backs up a preconfigured set of files timely.
- **An authenticated API for accessing a DataSet** : With access to a DataBase, filters, orders and joins data for a front end application to display.
- **A Live Sync tool for a Collaborative Software** : Used to be the source of truth for a user interface to sync data live with peers using a protocol such as WebRTC.


#### Business Operation (sayHello)
We have a single BOp called "sayHello" that receives a name property and returns an object where the greet property is a string saying `Hello <name given> !`. 

Learn more about [Business Operations](./architecture/)

#### Protocol (HTTP_JSONBODY)
We also have a single http protocol that reads the string given on the route and passes that string as the `name` property to the "sayHello" BOp.

Can you guess what that config does? Well, if you can't, there is no need for guesses. Let's try it out! 

### Time To Experiment!

With your system running, open your prefered web browser and head over to <a href="localhost:8080/myFirstSystem/World" target="_blank"> `localhost:8080/myFirstSystem/World` </a> ! 

You should have received a simple response with an object `{ result: "Hello World !" }`. Now try changing the route in the address bar to `localhost:8080/myFirstSystem/foo` and hit enter again. As you can see, the text following `myFirstSystem/` will be sent to the system, which will include it in the response. Try changing this text to your name or whatever other text you may like!

Now that we understand what the current config does, let's try changing it a bit:
Open the `example.json` file with your prefered text editor (such as Atom, VSCode or even notepad) and find, inside the `constants` of the Business Operation `sayHello` a constant named `"helloString"`. Here you will find three properties: name, type and value. Change "value" from `"Hello"` to `"Goodbye"` and save the file and restart your system (you can type `rs` on the console to do so).

Now try the same thing again on <a href="localhost:8080/myFirstSystem/My_Friend" target="_blank"> `localhost:8080/myFirstSystem/My_Friend` </a>. As you can see, by simply changing the constant, now you your system responds with goodbye instead of hello.

Wait, you want more? Let's go deeper then! Now, inside this config try finding the block where `"moduleName"` is `"output"`. This determines the output of your system. A bit lower, still inside this block, you'll find a property called `"dependencies"`, and inside that another one called `"origin"`. This origin is from which other module the output originates from. Try changing it from `2` to `3`, save the file and restart you system just like you did before and try the same <a href="localhost:8080/myFirstSystem/My_Friend" target="_blank"> `localhost:8080/myFirstSystem/My_Friend` </a> url again.

Now, this is new! The property result no longer is a text, but a group of values (also known as an Array) where the first item is `"Goodbye"`, the second is the text you type after `myFirstSystem/` and the third item a solitary `"!"`.

As you can see, you can easily modify the behavior of your system in just a few minutes! This is the power of Meta-System. Now, if you truly want to do wonders with this tool, you can keep playing around with this example config and when you are done head to the [Configuration Section](./configuring/basics.md) to learn all nooks and crannies of the Meta-System Configuration, and make your ideas come to life!
