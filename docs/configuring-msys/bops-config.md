# Business Operations (BOps)
The BOps are the heart of your business, they can be whatever you need them to be, and should specify the rules that guide your business on a daily basis.

Users cannot be younger than 13 years old? That's a business operation. Should you send an email when users complete their 10th purchase? Another BOps!

## Creating A BOps
In the configuration file, `"businessOperations"` is a list of objects. Each of those objects contains a chunk information for Meta-System to understand a part of the business rules of your company/product.
