## Guides to Creating Systems
If you're already familiar with the [configuration of Meta-System](../api-docs/configuring/basics) and just need some inspiration, we have some examples and in-depth explanations of configurations at the [Tutorials](../tutorials/tutorials.md) tab.

## Guides to Writing Addons
You just found yourself wanting your system to do more. The built in functions and what the community has built so far does not suit you well enough, or you thnk there is some secret logic you require and don't want it being passed around. If this describes your situation, you'll need to create your own Addon.

To do so, startby creating your new repository and be sure to install [`meta-system`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meta-system) with `npm i -g meta-system` and then head to the [Creating Addons](./creating-addons.md) page.

## Guides to Contributing to Meta-System
If would like to help, you are more than welcome to! There are a couple of ways in which you can help on making Meta-System more awesome, and they are all explained under [this documentation page](./contributing.md).
